# Basic Operations: Addition and Subtraction

The addition and subtraction are performed using the + and - operators. These are placed between two integer or float variable for computation.

```{r Addition, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
a <- 5
b <- 3

addition <- a+b
addition
```

```{r Subtraction, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
subtraction <- a-b
subtraction

```

# Basic Operations: Multiplication and Division

Multiplication and Division are performed using the * and / operators. These are placed between two integer or float variable for computation.

```{r Multiplication, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

c <- 6
d <- 3

multiplication <- c*d
multiplication
```

```{r Division, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

division <- c/d
division
```

---
# Other Operations: Modulo

Modulo returns the remainder after division is performed and is accessed using %% operator. This is placed between two integer or float variable for computation.

```{r Modulo, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

e <- 6
f <- 3

modulo <- c %% d
modulo
```

# Now it gets complicated, not really!!

# Order of execution

When multiple operators are used in an equation, the order of computation is done by using the BODMAS rule, which stands for Brackets, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.

Using the above information, compute the following and email me the answer

```{r Exerecise, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
answer<- a*(b*c)-e*d+(a-b)-d
answer
```
